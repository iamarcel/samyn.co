# Hello.

I'm on a mission to build better lives by building a better life.

I love showing people what's possible with technology, learning about a broad
range of topics and applying that combined knowledge to hard problems, thinking
about how to live a more enthousiastic life and giving insights, uncommon ideas
and help so we can grow together.
