It kind of feels like waking up from a nightmare.

That moment.

It could be while you're falling asleep after a lazy day, or when you're just
out, getting drunk and dancing inappropriately.

> ":shit:, I had resolutions. I was going to do it better this time."

It's okay, I've been there. We've all been there. 

But there's one habit that has prevented it from happening to me. It's so simple
you might stop reading---that's okay, just remember that **it doesn't count
until you're actually doing it**.

Still here? Awesome.

The root of the problem is basically that we forget; our big goals just slowly
start fading to the background. The simple solution? Set up a schedule to remind
yourself and re-commit to your goals regularly.

Every week, I answer a set of (difficult, confronting) questions to myself.
They're crafted based on what my goals and ambitions are, they force me to
re-connect with my resolutions *every single week*, so I can get a fresh start
every Sunday.

They're listed below, so take a pen and a piece of paper and answer all of them
(right now). Then keep that piece of paper where you see it often. Answer them
again next week and just keep going! Block some time in your agenda so you're
sure to remember this habit.

What are your habits for staying on top of your game? What are some of your
favorite questions to ask yourself? [Tweet to me about it!](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=marcelsamyn)
